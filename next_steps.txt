1. get all points from line fitting for both cams, aka fix saving of line fitting method DONE
2. solve bipartite graph problem to find least error correlation between points DONE
3. apply transf to matched pairs and measure 3d error DONE BUT HOW TO MEASURE ERROR?
4. 3d pruning + smoothing to fix error? plotly to visualise!
5. improve line fitting ?

Visualising problems: better tools?
